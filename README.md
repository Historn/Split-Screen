# 1. Introduction
Hello! My name is Arnau Jiménez and I am a second-year bachelor's student in video game design and development at the [CITM](https://www.citm.upc.edu/) at [Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya](https://www.upc.edu/en).

This website is built for information regarding my Personal Research lecture I delivered about Split Screens in video games for Project II subject.

# 2. What is a split screen?
A split screen is a technique where the screen is separated in two or more pieces to display different media at the same time.

# 3. What is a split screen for?

- To show different things at he same time.

- To allow more than one player to play in the same game.

- To allow players to move around without depending on the other players.

# 4. When should a split screen appear?

- The split screen should be created for a local multiplayer game or for a game where we need to display things in different windows such as resource management games. This way we can play with more players without Internet connection or manage resources and other stuff in our game without moving on from the gameplay screen.

# 5. Things to take into consideration when making a split screen

- The more number of viewports, the higher the performance impact is.

# 7. Application to our projects

Now is time for you and your team to implement what we have done into your projects, then you will have an easy and totally functional split screen mode for your games!
